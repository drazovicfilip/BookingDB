# BookingDB
Member booking database system. Implemented for the major project for my databases class. All frontend was provided, but SQL and integration was written by me. 

All SQL is implemented in the database.py file. Run using run.bat (win) or run.command (mac). An instance of Postgres will need to be running (using pgAdmin) first.
